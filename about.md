## About

I’m a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist with 5+ years of experience building and supporting NGS secondary and tertiary analysis pipelines in clinical and research environments. My work focuses on delivering reproducible, high-throughput analysis that scales on cloud platforms and simplifies customer adoption.

Core strengths

- NGS pipelines: secondary & tertiary analysis, variant calling, RNA‑seq, and multi‑omics
- Workflow orchestration: Nextflow, Snakemake — productionized pipelines for reproducibility and scale
- Performance & optimization: benchmarking DRAGEN vs Parabricks, runtime and accuracy improvements
- Cloud & containers: AWS (S3, EC2, Batch), Azure, Docker, CI/CD automation

I enjoy turning complex genomics data problems into automated, well-documented pipelines and tools that researchers and clinicians can rely on.
