## Problem

Organizations needed reproducible, production-grade pipelines for secondary and tertiary analysis that could be deployed on cloud platforms and integrated into customer-facing analytics products.

## Role

Pipeline engineer: implemented Nextflow-based DRAGEN workflows, containerized analytics modules, and CI/CD for validation and deployment.

## Approach

- Developed Nextflow workflows for DRAGEN-based tertiary analysis and integrated containerized Python/R modules for downstream analysis.
- Built CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins for automated deployment and regression testing.
- Implemented Django-based visualization tools to help internal teams and customers troubleshoot and explore results.

## Outcome

- Contributed to a **25% increase** in platform adoption for Illumina Connected Analytics through robust, production-ready workflows.
- Automated releases and tests reduced pipeline release time by **40%** and improved overall quality.
