## Problem

Research projects required standardized, reproducible pipelines to analyze diverse sequencing assays and produce reliable results for downstream analysis.

## Role

Research pipeline developer: implemented and maintained Snakemake workflows for multiple assay types and supported collaborators in generating actionable results.

## Approach

- Built Snakemake pipelines for bulk RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, RRBS and single-cell workflows with clear input/output contracts and documentation.
- Ensured reproducibility via containerization and standardized reference data management.
- Collaborated with biologists to interpret results and iterate on analysis parameters.

## Outcome

- Improved reproducibility and throughput for several translational cancer research projects; enabled faster, reliable analysis and downstream interpretation.
